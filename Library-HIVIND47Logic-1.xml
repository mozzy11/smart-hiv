 * Library: HIV.IND.47 Logic
 * Ref No: TBH.4
 * Short Name: People living with HIV with active TB disease
 *
 * Definition: % of people living with HIV newly initiated on ART who have active TB disease
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people living with HIV newly initiated on ART during the reporting period who have active TB disease. | &quot;Newly initiated on ART&quot; is defined as the number of people living with HIV who start ART in accordance with national treatment guidelines during the reporting period.
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND &quot;ART start date&quot; in the reporting period AND &quot;Date of TB diagnosis&quot; in the reporting period
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people living with HIV new on ART during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND &quot;ART start date&quot; in reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*)
 * • Age (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50+ years)**
 * • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)***
 * • Pregnant women or breastfeeding women
 * • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 * 
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type | Currently pregnant | Breastfeeding
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * ART start date | Date of TB diagnosis | HIV status
 *
 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 *  
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth 
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client* 
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female 
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male 
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male 
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female 
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category 
 * HIV.B.DE29: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant 
 * HIV.B.DE32: Breastfeeding | Infant is being breastfed by mother 
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in 
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker 
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men 
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting 
 * HIV.B.DE72: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis. 
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive 
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative 
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status 
 * HIV.D.DE31: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant 
 * HIV.D.DE32: Breastfeeding | Client is giving infant breast milk 
 * HIV.D.DE39: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted ART 
 * HIV.D.DE952: Date of TB diagnosis | The date when the diagnosis was established 
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in 
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker 
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures the burden of active TB disease among people living with HIV who are newly initiated on ART.
 * - rationale: • Early detection of TB among people living with HIV enables prompt TB treatment and early ART. | • This indicator also measures indirectly the extent of efforts to detect HIV-associated TB.
 * - method: For the numerator and denominator: Programme records (for example, pre-ART and ART registers, TB register at the TB management unit) |  | The recommended national reporting period is 12 months, with monthly or quarterly reporting at subnational levels. |  | Note: Data are drawn from TB- and HIV-sided services and data sources. This indicator is related to indicator DFT.4. TB diagnosis among those tested for TB. However, the latter covers only TB diagnosed as a result of symptom screening of people living with HIV newly initiated on ART (that is, it does not cover TB cases initiated on ART that were referred from TB clinics).
