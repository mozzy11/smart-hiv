 * Library: HIV.IND.45 Logic
 * Ref No: TBH.2
 * Short Name: TPT completion
 *
 * Definition: Number and % of people living with HIV on ART who completed a course of TB preventive treatment among those who initiated TPT
 *
 * Numerator: Number of ART patients who completed a course of TPT during the reporting period
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND &quot;On ART&quot;=True AND &quot;TB preventive treatment (TPT) start date&quot; in the previous period AND &quot;TB preventive treatment (TPT) status&quot;='Completed'
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of ART patients who initiated any course of TPT during the previous reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND &quot;On ART&quot;=True AND &quot;TB preventive treatment (TPT) start date&quot; in the prior reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*)
 * • Age (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50+ years)**
 * • Type of TPT regimen
 * • ART initiation (&lt;12 months on ART, 12+ months on ART)
 * • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 * 
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | TPT regimen type | ART start date (&lt;12 months on ART, ≥12 months on ART)
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * HIV status | On ART | TB preventive treatment (TPT) start date | TB preventive treatment (TPT) status
 *
 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 *  
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth 
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client* 
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female 
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male 
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male 
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female 
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category 
 * HIV.B.DE72: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis. 
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive 
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative 
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status 
 * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 * HIV.D.DE39: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted ART 
 * HIV.D.DE954: TB preventive treatment (TPT) start date | The date on which the client began taking TPT 
 * HIV.D.DE1028: TPT regimen type | Type of TPT regimen the client is currently on 
 * HIV.D.DE1029: 3HP | The client's current TPT regimen is 3HP 
 * HIV.D.DE1030: 1HP | The client's current TPT regimen is 1HP 
 * HIV.D.DE1031: 6H | The client's current TPT regimen is 6H 
 * HIV.D.DE1032: Six months of levofloxacin daily | The client's current TPT regimen is six months of levofloxacin daily 
 * HIV.D.DE1033: Other TB preventive treatment (TPT) regimen | The client's current TPT regimen is another regimen than those listed above 
 * HIV.D.DE1034: TB preventive treatment (TPT) status | Indicates the current status of TB preventive treatment (TPT) 
 * HIV.D.DE1035: Not started | The client did not start the TB preventive treatment (TPT) 
 * HIV.D.DE1036: On TPT | The client started the TB preventive treatment (TPT) and is currently taking the medication, without treatment interruptions 
 * HIV.D.DE1037: On TPT with interruptions | The client started the TB preventive treatment (TPT) and is currently taking the medication, with treatment interruptions 
 * HIV.D.DE1038: On hold | The health care worker has temporarily stopped the TB preventive treatment (TPT), but TPT is expected to continue again later. May also be called &quot;suspended&quot;. 
 * HIV.D.DE1039: Completed | TB preventive treatment (TPT) was completed 
 * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures the effectiveness of scaled-up TPT programmes by assessing the proportion of patients who completed the recommended course of TPT.
 * - rationale: • Many countries have made progress in initiating eligible people living with HIV on TPT. However, rates of TPT completion remain poor or unknown. | • Assessment of TPT completion is a critical element of the TB/HIV cascade of services.
 * - method: For the numerator and denominator: Programme records (for example, ART registers) |  | Defining &quot;previous reporting period&quot;: For example, for annual reporting of January to December 2021, the previous reporting period is January to December 2020 (except for programmes with 1HP-exclusive national guidelines and implementation, in which case they may use January to December 2021). For quarterly or semi-annual reporting to the national level, the previous reporting period will depend on the TPT regimen and duration defined by national guidelines. |  | Note: For programmes using continuous isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), TPT completion is defined as six months of treatment. |
