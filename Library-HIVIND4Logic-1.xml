 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting 
 * HIV.PRV.DE28: Number of days prescribed | Days of medication client has been prescribed
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: The total volume of PrEP product prescribed can be used to forecast future commodity needs.
 * - rationale: The total volume of PrEP product prescribed or dispensed can be used to calculate the total number of days (or months/years) available for product use, which can be used derive indicators examining the level of PrEP provided relative to need.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records. Either the volume of PrEP prescribed or the volume of product dispensed can be used if this is available, for example from pharmacy data. |  | The total volume of PrEP product prescribed (or dispensed) can then be used to derive the total number of days (or months/years) of product use based on the duration of HIV prevention provided by each unit of product. Such an indicator could be described, for example, as | the number of person-years of PrEP protection provided. This measure can then be used to examine the level of PrEP availability to monitor trends and for modelling the impact of PrEP at the population level. It can also be used to derive the following additional indicators useful for understanding the quantity of PrEP product available relative to need: |  | a) numerator:total number of days available for product use; denominator: total number of PrEP recipients | b) numerator:total number of days available for product use; denominator: estimates of the total number of people who would benefit from PrEP
