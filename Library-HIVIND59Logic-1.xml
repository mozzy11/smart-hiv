 * Library: HIV.IND.59 Logic
 * Ref No: STI.1B
 * Short Name: Syphilis testing coverage, HIV-positive clients
 *
 * Definition: % of people living with HIV who were tested for syphilis during the reporting period
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people living with HIV tested for syphilis while attending HIV care and treatment services
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND with &quot;Syphilis test date&quot; in the reporting period
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people living with HIV attending HIV care and treatment services
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients  with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' with a &quot;Visit date&quot; in the reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*)
 * • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–49, 50+ years)
 * • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)**
 * • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 * 
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * HIV status | Syphilis test date | Visit date
 *
 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 *  
 * HIV.A.DE3: Visit date | The date and time of the client's visit 
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth 
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client* 
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female 
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male 
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male 
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female 
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category 
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in 
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker 
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men 
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting 
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis. 
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive 
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative 
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status 
 * HIV.B.DE249: Syphilis test date | Date of syphilis test 
 * HIV.D.DE801: Syphilis test date | Date of syphilis test 
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in 
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker 
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting 
 * HIV.G.DE69: Syphilis test date | Date of syphilis test
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were tested for syphilis during the reporting period | B: % of people living with HIV who were tested for syphilis during the reporting period  | C: % of pregnant women who were tested for syphilis during the reporting period
 * - rationale: • Measuring the burden of syphilis among people living with HIV and among populations at elevated risk of HIV acquisition can help national planners determine the resources needed to address both diseases. | • Testing pregnant women for syphilis is important for their own health, and it is also the first step in the prevention of vertical transmission of syphilis. Knowing the testing coverage contributes to quality assessment across the full scope of antenatal care services. | • Testing for syphilis identifies individuals who would benefit from treatment. | • Testing coverage measures progress towards scaling up screening/testing and can be used to assess whether national screening guidelines are being followed.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data. If aggregate data are used and it is not possible to exclude individuals who are tested more than once during the reporting period, the testing coverage estimates will be inflated. |  | Testing (screening) may be done using either a nontreponemal test (for example, venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) or a treponemal test | (for example, Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay [TPHA], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TPPA], enzyme immunoassay or rapid treponemal test). For this indicator, having either type of test (treponemal or nontreponemal) is sufficient, although being tested with both is preferred.
