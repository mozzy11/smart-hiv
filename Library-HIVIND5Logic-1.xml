 * • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental)
 * • Setting: facility-based service (including hospitals, health clinics, general practice offices, etc.) or community-based service (including drop-in centres, community service delivery points, mobile clinics or vans, outreach teams, community support groups, etc.)
 * • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *

 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female 
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category 
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in 
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker 
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men 
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting 
 * HIV.B.DE61: HIV exposure type* | Ways in which the client was exposed to HIV 
 * HIV.B.DE62: Occupational | Occupational exposure to HIV

 * HIV.B.DE64: Non-occupational consensual sex | Exposure to HIV through non-occupational consensual sex 
 * HIV.C.DE74: Date medications prescribed | Date the client was prescribed medications 
 * HIV.C.DE75: Medications prescribed | Medications the client was prescribed 
 * HIV.C.DE76: PrEP for HIV prevention | Client was prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention 
 * HIV.C.DE77: PEP for HIV prevention | Client was prescribed post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV prevention 
 * HIV.C.DE78: Other | Client was prescribed other medications 
 * HIV.D.DE457: Medications prescribed | Name or regimen code of all other medications prescribed during the visit 
 * HIV.D.DE458: Date medications prescribed | Date the medications were prescribed 
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in 
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker 
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting 
 * HIV.PRV.DE27: Date medications prescribed | Date the client was prescribed medications
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measure of total number of individuals receiving PEP in a defined period.
 * - rationale: PEP should be offered and initiated as early as possible for all individuals with an exposure that has the potential for HIV transmission, preferably within 72 hours.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: continuous-variable | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/cv-measure-cqfm
