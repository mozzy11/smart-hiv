 * Library: HIV.IND.40 Logic
 * Ref No: VER.4
 * Short Name: ART coverage in pregnant women
 *
 * Definition: % of HIV-positive pregnant women who received ART during pregnancy and/or at labour and delivery
 *
 * Numerator: Number of HIV-positive pregnant women who delivered during the reporting period and received ART during pregnancy and/or at labour and delivery
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of women with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND &quot;Delivery date&quot; in the reporting period AND ((&quot;On ART&quot;=True at labour and delivery) OR (&quot;On ART&quot;=True during pregnancy, for this pregnancy))
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: a) Programme-based/service delivery denominator | Number of HIV-positive pregnant women who delivered during the reporting period and attended ANC or had a facility-based delivery | b) Population-based denominator | Number of HIV-positive pregnant women who delivered during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: Programme-based/service delivery denominator: | COUNT of women with &quot;HIV status&quot;='HIV-positive' AND &quot;Delivery date&quot; in the reporting period AND (had an &quot;ANC contact date&quot; during reporting period OR &quot;Place of delivery&quot; was a 'Health facility') |  | Population-based denominator: | *Number of HIV-positive pregnant women who delivered during the reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * Numerator:
 * • Timing of ART initiation (1. already on ART at first ANC visit, 2. newly on ART during pregnancy, 3. newly on ART during labour and delivery, 4. on non-recommended ART regimen)
 * 
 * The primary indicator calculation should include ART status categories 1, 2 and 3. Removing the women in category 1 &quot;already on ART at first ANC visit&quot; from the numerator and denominator gives a measure of ART coverage among HIV-positive pregnant women newly diagnosed during ANC. Dividing category 2 by the sum of categories 2 and 3 gives the proportion of new ART initiations occurring during pregnancy rather than at delivery. Calculating the indicator with those in category 4 (non-recommended ARV regimen) included in the numerator gives a broader measure, that is, coverage of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving any ARV drug.
 * 
 * Disaggregation Elements: Timing of ART initiation
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * ANC contact date | Delivery date | HIV status | On ART | Place of delivery
 *
 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 *  
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis. 
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive 
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative 
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status 
 * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 * HIV.E.DE41: Timing of ART initiation | When the pregnant woman or mother initiated ART, for women living with HIV. 
 * HIV.E.DE42: Already on ART at first antenatal care visit | The pregnant woman was already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at first antenatal care visit 
 * HIV.E.DE43: Newly on ART during pregnancy | The pregnant woman started ART during her pregnancy 
 * HIV.E.DE44: Newly on ART during labour and delivery | The woman started ART during labour and delivery 
 * HIV.E.DE46: Delivery date | Date on which the woman delivered 
 * HIV.E.DE67: Place of delivery | The type of place where the woman delivered 
 * HIV.E.DE68: Health facility | The woman delivered at a health facility 
 * HIV.E.DE69: Home | The woman delivered at home 
 * HIV.E.DE70: Other | The woman delivered at another location that is not at home or at a health facility 
 * HIV.E.DE85: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date') 
 * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures whether a recommended course of ART has been provided to HIV-positive pregnant women.
 * - rationale: • Providing ART for HIV-positive pregnant women is a critical strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HIV. | • In an era of &quot;Treat All&quot;, all HIV-positive pregnant women should be given a recommended regimen of ART as soon as possible after diagnosis, including during labour and delivery.
 * - method: a) For the numerator and programme-based/service delivery denominator: Programme records (for example, PMTCT registers, ARV registers, labour and delivery registers) |  | b) For the population-based denominator: Modelling-based estimates (for example, Spectrum AIM) |  | The recommended reporting period is 12 months.
